\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Candle, cardboard/3 toilet paper tubes, nail, string}
\item[Setup:]{Cut 3 rectangular pieces of cardboard or use 3 toilet paper tubes. Poke a hole at the center of each using a nail. The holes should all be equal distance from the bottom.}
\item[Procedure:]{Arrange the cardboard pieces in a straight line - pass a string through the holes and pull tight to do this. Place the candle or light source near card A and look through card C. Displace any of the 3 cards and look again.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
\item[Observations:]{The light can be seen when all holes are in a straight line, but not when any card is moved.}
\item[Theory:]{Light travels in a straight line. The ray of light cannot be seen through card C when there is an obstruction in its path.}

\subsection{Light Through a Comb}

\begin{center}

\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Comb, light source, paper, cardboard}
%\item[Setup:]{}
\item[Procedure:]{Hold a comb on a white paper placed on a table near a window. Place cardboard on either side of the comb.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
\item[Observations:]{Parallel beams of light can be seen on the paper.}
\item[Theory:]{Light travels in a straight line, so beams of sunlight passing through the slits in the comb appear in parallel lines on the paper.}
%\item[Applications:]{}
%\item[Notes:]{}

\subsection{Ray Boxes}

\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Torch, paper funnel, comb, card, tin can, candle}
%\item[Setup:]{}
\item[Procedure:]{Many experiments with light require thin beams of light. Make a ray box using one of the methods shown.}

\subsection{Pinhole Camera}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Tin/cardboard box/manila paper, glue, pin, candle}
\item[Setup:]{Roll a piece of manila paper to make a cylinder. Glue a circular piece of card on one end and poke a hole with a pin. Make a second cylinder to fit tightly in the first. Cover one end with plain paper to act as a screen, and close the other end with a card. At the center of the card make a large 2 cm diameter hole.}
\item[Procedure:]{Observe a burning candle by looking through the large hole. Adjust the inner cylinder to get a sharp image. Adjust the distance between screen and pinhole, as well as between candle and pinhole.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
\item[Observations:]{The image of the candle is real and inverted. When the distance from screen to pinhole is increased, the image becomes larger and more blurred. When the candle is closer to the pinhole, the image gets smaller and sharper.}
\item[Theory:]{The rays of light from the candle cross at the pinhole and thus show up on the screen as an inverted image.}

\section*{Reflection of Light}


\subsection{Laws of Reflection}

\end{center}

\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Plane mirror, pins/syringe needles, paper, ruler, protractor}
\item[Setup:]{Attach a plane mirror to a block of wood.}
\item[Procedure:]{Stand up the mirror and trace a straight line along its base. Place a pin at O a few cm from the mirror. Look at the mirror from the right side and place to pins P$_1$ and P$_2$ so that they appear in a straight line with the image. Repeat for the left side using pins P$_3$ and P$_4$. Remove the mirror and pins and join the straight lines to meet at I behind the mirror.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
\item[Questions:]{Measure and compare the distances ON and NI using a ruler. Measure angles $i$ and $r$ with a protractor.}
\item[Observations:]{The distances ON and NI are equal. The angles $i$ and $r$ are equal.}
\item[Theory:]{The laws of reflection for a plane mirror state that: (1) object distance (ON) and image distance (NI) are equal; and (2) the angle of incidence ($i$) and angle of reflection ($r$) are equal.}

\subsection{Images Formed in Multiple Mirrors}
\textbf{*NECTA PRACTICAL*}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./img/source/multiple-mirrors.png}
\end{center}

\begin{description*}
%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{2 plane mirrors, pin, paper, protractor}
%\item[Setup:]{}
\item[Procedure:]{Place to mirrors upright at right angles to each other. Place a pin (Object) in between them. Look at the mirrors and count the number of images seen. Repeat with mirrors at angles of 60$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
\item[Questions:]{How many images can be seen in each case?}
\item[Observations:]{At right angles, 3 images are produced; at 60$^\circ$, 5 images; and at 45$^\circ$, 7 images.}
\item[Theory:]{For an angle $\theta$ between the mirrors, the number of images produced $n$ follows the relationship $n = \frac{360^\circ}{\theta} - 1$.}
